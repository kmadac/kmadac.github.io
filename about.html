  <p>
    Kamil works as Storage/System engineer at biiig international company. When he's not
    doing that, he's <a href="http://kmadac.github.io">blogging</a>,
    hacking on <a href="https://github.com/kmadac">open source</a>,
    building new Openstack installations, programming,  
    preparing new multi-cloud hosting solution Cloust, and learning new things.
    I'm automation fan and I like to have automated as most things as is possible, 
    but not his life :). 
    He has proficiency in Python, but also knew something about C, C# and Bash.
    If he will have free time, he plans to learn Ruby.

    Kamil used to have a pretty, bad-ass and eye-candy bloated curriculum here,
    but, well, there is so much places to update. So, check his
